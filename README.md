<p align="center"><strong>Slipstream</strong> is the most informative Home-media backup solution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

---

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

Slipstream's goal is to provide the user's a dead-simple process for backing up their legally owned home-media to a wide array of formats, including a full backup. Slipstream can be used with it's GUI, as CLI, or as an importable package. It's trying to be different from the other solutions out there by providing as much information about the home-media as one could need while being stupid simple to use.

## Working with the Source Code

### Install from Source Code

    git clone https://github.com/rlaPHOENiX/Slipstream.git
    cd Slipstream
    python -m pip install --user .

Note however that there are some caveats when installing from Source Code:

- Source Code may have changes that are not yet tested or stable, and may have regressions.
- Only install from Source-code if you have a reason, e.g. to test changes.
- Requires [Poetry] as itâ€™s used as the build system backend.

This project uses [Poetry] so feel free to use it for its various conveniences like building
sdist/wheel packages, creating and managing dependencies, virtual environments, and more.

  [Poetry]: <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>

### Building source and wheel distributions

    poetry build

You can specify `-f` to build `sdist` or `wheel` only.

### Packing with PyInstaller

    python -m pip install --user pyinstaller
    poetry run pyinstaller Slipstream.spec
    .\dist\Slipstream.exe

Feel free to apply any CLI options/switches you feel like, see `pyinstaller -h`.
