<p align="center"><strong>Slipstream</strong> is the most informative Home-media backup solution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

---

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

Slipstream's goal is to provide the user's a dead-simple process for backing up their legally owned home-media to a wide array of formats, including a full backup. Slipstream can be used with it's GUI, as CLI, or as an importable package. It's trying to be different from the other solutions out there by providing as much information about the home-media as one could need while being stupid simple to use.

# Call for designers

This project is looking for a Logo, Icon, and Banner artwork. If you have some free time and would like to contribute one (or all :O) to this project, please do!  
Not begging for a billion-dollar design, just something unique that shows off the project well.

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

# Quick Installation

    python -m pip install --user pslipstream

If you wish to manually install from the source, take a look at [Building](#building) below.

# Usage

To run Slipstream, type `pslipstream` into Terminal, App Launcher, or Start Menu.

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

## Building

    git clone https://github.com/rlaPHOENiX/Slipstream.git
    cd Slipstream

> Note:

Now you have three options, `dist`, `pack`, or `install`:

- `dist`, Build the source into a package file that's shareable and installable with pip, will be in /dist:  
  `python setup.py dist`
- `pack`, Build and pack the source with PyInstaller, resulting in a single portable binary file, will be in /dist:  
  `python -m pip install PyInstaller`  
  `python setup.py pack`
- `install`, Build the source and install it with pip, essentially the same result as [Quick Installation](#installation) but without PyPI.org:  
  `python -m pip install --user .`

Once built, use it as you please. If you went the `install` route, follow [Usage](#usage).
